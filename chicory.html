            <p>India has one of the highest consumption of chicory mixed coffee in the world. </p>

            <p>  Surprisingly though (or may be not!), most of us have no clue what it is all about! Is it good, is it bad, is it neutral? </p>
                
            <p>  We, at cafena Coffee, believe an educated customer is the best customer. Here’s what we know. </p>
                
            <h2>  WHAT IS CHICORY? </h2>
                
            <p>Like ginger and turmeric, it is the root of a cultivated plant species, Chicorium Intybus. For ease of understanding, let us call it the chicory plant. A native of France, this plant belongs to the dandelion family. It has a tough, hairy stem and light purple flowers and leaves.</p>
            <p> Dried, minced, roasted and ground chicory looks very similar to coffee. Except for the aroma, of course! It is gentle bitter-sweet woody aroma blends perfectly well with that of coffee’s.</p>

            <p> Like ginger and turmeric, chicory powder comes from the root of a cultivated plant species, Chicorium Intybus. </p>
            <p> Chicory cultivation in India began only from 1950. Prior to this, users imported it from Europe.</p>

            <p> In India, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat account for 97% of its cultivation.</p>
